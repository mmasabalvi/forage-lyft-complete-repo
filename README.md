# Lyft System Code Refactoring

Overview:


This repository hosts my comprehensive refactoring of the Lyft system, undertaken as part of the Forage Backend Engineering Job Sim by Lyft. The primary goal of this refactoring effort is to enhance the overall codebase by improving readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

The UML Class Diagram, initially provided, guided and informed the necessary changes made during the refactoring process. This concise structure emphasizes the integration of the UML Class Diagram and its role in informing the refactoring efforts.
